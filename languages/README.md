# Languages Directory

This directory is intended to store translation files for the Bulk Post Scheduler plugin, making it accessible to a global audience.

## File Types:

*   **`.pot` (Portable Object Template):** This is the master template file generated by scanning the plugin's source code for translatable strings. It serves as the basis for creating new translations.
    *   The POT file should be named `bulk-post-scheduler.pot`.
*   **`.po` (Portable Object):** These files contain the actual translations for specific languages. Each language will have its own `.po` file (e.g., `bulk-post-scheduler-es_ES.po` for Spanish).
*   **`.mo` (Machine Object):** These are compiled versions of `.po` files, optimized for WordPress to read quickly. They are generated from the `.po` files.

## Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n):

The plugin code should be properly internationalized using WordPress functions like `__()`, `_e()`, `_x()`, `_n()`, etc., with a unique text domain (e.g., `bulk-post-scheduler`).

This directory will house the resulting translation files provided by translators or generated using translation tools.
