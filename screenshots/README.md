# Screenshots Directory

This directory is used to store screenshots for the Bulk Post Scheduler plugin. These screenshots are displayed on the WordPress.org plugin repository page and in the plugin's `readme.txt` file.

## Naming Convention:

Screenshots should be named sequentially, for example:

*   `screenshot-1.png` (or `.jpg`)
*   `screenshot-2.png` (or `.jpg`)
*   `screenshot-3.png` (or `.jpg`)
*   ...and so on.

## Content:

Screenshots should clearly illustrate:
*   The plugin's main interface (e.g., the bulk scheduling modal).
*   Key features in action.
*   The admin settings page (if applicable).
*   The integration with WordPress bulk actions.
*   The process of using the plugin for WPAutoBlog users.

Ensure that the screenshots are:
*   Clear and high-resolution.
*   Representative of the plugin's functionality.
*   Described accurately in the `readme.txt` file.

These screenshots are crucial for users to understand how the plugin works and what it looks like before installing it.
